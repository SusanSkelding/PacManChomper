# PacManChomper
In this program PacMan chomps his way across the screen. When he hits the boundary at the side of the page he changes direction and moves back in the opposite direction until he hits that boundary. He repeats that movement as long as the browser page is open.

## Installation
Clone the files to your local machine and open them in your prefered code editor where you can preview the working program.

## Future Plans
I hope to add multiple PacMen and get them to behave as if they recognize one another and stop and "talk" to one another along their paths for a set amount of time before they continue on their paths.
